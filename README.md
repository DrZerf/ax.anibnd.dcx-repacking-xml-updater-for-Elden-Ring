A small quality-of-life tool for modders. This program updates the witchybnd repacking XML of ax.anibnd.dcx files after inserting new animations, eliminating the need to manually edit your XML repacking file.

The program works for the following files:
- c0000_a00_hi-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a00_lo-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a00_md-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a0x-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a1x-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a2x-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a3x-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a4x-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a5x-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a6x-anibnd-dcx
- c0000_a9x-anibnd-dcx

Usage Instructions:

1. Add all desired animations to the compendium folder, where the .hks files are located.
2. Copy the file path of the compendium folder.
3. Launch the ax_anibnd_repacking_xml_generator.exe.
4. Press Ctrl+V to paste the path and press Enter.
5. If all steps were executed correctly, your XML should now be updated to include all lines for the new animations, and you should observe a backup file that will be automatically generated.
